## üìä Analysis Overview

### **Dataset Scope**
- **Time Period:** 3-year span of layoffs data
- **Geographic Coverage:** Global companies across multiple countries
- **Industries:** Technology, Crypto, Consumer, Healthcare, and more
- **Metrics:** Total layoffs, percentage layoffs, funding data, company stages

## üîç Key Analysis Areas

### **1. Maximum Impact Assessment**
*Identified the most severe layoffs in the dataset*

```sql
SELECT MAX(total_laid_off), MAX(percentage_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_dummy;
```

### **2. Complete Company Closures**
*Found companies that laid off 100% of their workforce*

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM layoffs_dummy
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC;
```

### **3. Company-Level Analysis**
*Ranked companies by total layoffs across the entire period*

```sql
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_dummy
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### **4. Industry Impact Analysis**
*Determined which industries were hit hardest by layoffs*

```sql
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_dummy
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### **5. Geographic Distribution**
*Analyzed layoff patterns across different countries*

```sql
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_dummy
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### **6. Temporal Trends**
*Examined layoff patterns over time with year-wise breakdown*

```sql
SELECT YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_dummy
GROUP BY YEAR(`date`)
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

### **7. Rolling Totals Analysis**
*Calculated cumulative layoffs month-over-month using advanced SQL*

```sql
WITH Rolling_Total AS (
    SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`,1,7) AS Month, SUM(total_laid_off) AS Total_layoff
    FROM layoffs_dummy
    WHERE SUBSTRING(`date`,1,7) IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY Month
    ORDER BY 1 ASC
)
SELECT Month, Total_layoff, 
       SUM(Total_layoff) OVER(ORDER BY Month) AS rolling_total 
FROM Rolling_Total;
```

### **8. Top Companies by Year**
*Advanced ranking analysis using window functions and CTEs*

```sql
WITH Company_Rank AS (
    SELECT company, YEAR(`date`) as Years, SUM(total_laid_off) as Total_laid_off
    FROM layoffs_dummy
    GROUP BY company, YEAR(`date`)
), Top_Companies AS (
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY Years ORDER BY Total_laid_off DESC) AS Rankings 
    FROM Company_Rank
    WHERE Years IS NOT NULL
) 
SELECT * FROM Top_Companies WHERE Rankings <= 5;
```
